```

## When we prefer R over Python

+ Ad-Hoc Data Exploration
+ Better Graphics
+ Statistical Models with only a few lines
+ Statistical models are more readily available
+ RMarkdown works  smoother with GitHub merges
+ Better handles missing data

## What we will cover:
### R Tidyverse


 ![](~/Dropbox/Shiny Tutorial/tidyverse_flow.png) 
 



```{r echo = TRUE}
# Brief summary on major packagies
```
 
 
We will focus on Dplyr, Tidyr/Tibble,GGplot2. 
 
# Install and Load 'Tidyverse'
```{r echo = TRUE, warning= FALSE, error=FALSE, message= FALSE}
#install.packages('tidyverse')
library('tidyverse')
```

```{r echo = TRUE}
# Data source: https://www.investing.com 
# Maria loads dollar to diff currency datasets
# Maria merges and transforms them using dplyr, etc 
# Maria shows grouping by month year with tidy syntax 
# Maria plots various  time series plots in ggplot2 by year, country
# Maria shows easy time series forecast 
```

```{r}
# Whatever Cristian feels like showing
```

# Now let's do exercises:

```{r}
# Something easy to do with iris dataset as it comes with ggplot2 package
```
